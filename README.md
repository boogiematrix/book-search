# Book Search Engine

## Description
This is a Google Books API search engine. It was refactored from a fully functioning RESTful API into one built with Apollo Server and using GraphQL. The app was based on the MERN stack  model with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
